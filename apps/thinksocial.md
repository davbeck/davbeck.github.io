# ThinkSocial for Mastodon: Currently in beta

Instead of scrolling vertically through your timeline, 
ThinkSocial shows the full detail of each post, and you swipe right 
to left to go through the timeline. I think this small change encourages 
better engagement and more focus on each individual post.

The app is still missing critical features, such as posting and notifications. 
Because of that, I am limiting the number of beta testers. 
As the app gets more complete I will continue to increase the number of spots 
available so make sure to [follow me](https://mastodon.social/@davbeck) for updates.

## Roadmap

I'm a single developer with a separate fulltime job and a family, so work on ThinkSocial is 
may be slower than we all want. That being said, my goal is to have a basic version
available in the App Store by this Summer.

Here's a rough picture of priorities leading up to that release.

- Media excellence
    - Fullscreen image viewing
    - Custom emoji
    - Media preloading
- Alternate timelines ⬅️ You are here
    - Federated and local timelines

    - Open links in the app with settings to customize
    - Detail screens for things like bookmarks and who boosted a post
- Posting and replying

    - I'm hoping to impliment some advanced filtering, especially across accounts, but this may get cut for 1.0.
