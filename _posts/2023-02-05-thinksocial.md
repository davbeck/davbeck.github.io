Trunk, the Mastodon app for iOS with a unique horizontal timeline is now ThinkSocial for Mastodon.

When I was preparing for the original TestFlight launch of the app, I wasn't even sure I was going to finish the app. I was mostly concerned with creating a proof of concept and getting some immediate feedback about the usefulness of a horizontal timeline.

But to upload an app, even a beta to TestFlight, you have to call it something. And "Untitled Mastodon App" was to big to fit on the homescreen. I searched for a Mastodon body part that wasn't already taken, and eventually settled on "Trunk". But everytime I use that name I think of either [Dragon Ball Z](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Trunks), or [swimwear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_trunks). And it's [not that](https://communitywiki.org/trunk) [unique](https://mstdn.social/@trunksapp).

Why "ThinkSocial"? For years I have published apps under the "ThinkUltimate" business name[^1]. None of those apps have been very successful, but they have included "ThinkMessenger", "ThinkDialer", "ThinkScore" as well as several others that never shipped. I hope to eventually be able to have a sustainable business making indie apps, and having a consistent naming system seems useful.

If you're interested in trying out ThinkSocial, you can [join the beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/1ir4E70u) and [follow me](https://tnku.co/@david) for more updates. ThinkSocial uses a horizontal timeline that puts the full context of each post front and center which encourages a more focused, deeper experience.

[^1]: A few years ago I let `thinkultimate.com` expire. Someone is now squating on it and wants over $5,000 for it. When Mastodon first started to gain traction last Fall I almost bought `think.social` but passed on it and someone took that one as well (although there's no price listed so maybe they are looking to do something with it). Let that be a lesson: hoard your domains.
